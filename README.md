Project Title and Description: Challenge 2, because... it is challenge 2

I like berserk, so I made this page in honor of the angriest man on earth. It has the same sections as the mock up, but I tried to make them for good old Guts. The website is now responsive, as far as I could make it, because sometimes the images and even fonts make some weird stuff


Installation:

This page is going to be in my repository on github: https://github.com/mxmar0k/02-Challenge

Usage:

This is a pretty standart page, but it is moreless functional, it has links, more links, images, and it is quite responsive.

It really can be used as a starting point for more robust projects with more functions and a cool "work page/cv/etc".

Credits:

I want to thank my professor and my TA for amazing lessons, and to my coffe, because without them, I wouldn't know what to do and probably be sleeping, thinking about making this hw, which I seem to have finished!

HAVE A GREAT WEEK OR WEEKEND, DEPENDING WHEN YOU WATCH THIS.

ps. i really dont know how to make a readme, but chatgpt said it was more o less like this.
